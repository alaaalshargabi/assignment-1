    "1. Machine learning is the study of how to use computers to simulate human learning activities; it is the study of computers gain new knowledge and new skills, identify existing knowledge, and continuously improve performance and achieve self-improvement methods.\n",

    "2. A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. \n",

    "3. Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Arthur Samuel, 1959**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.\n",
